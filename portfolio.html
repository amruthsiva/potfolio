                     <font size="3">Founded in 1878 as a manufacturer
                     of bicycles, Rover produced its first automobile in 1904. 
                     It was a Rover 8 model that laid the foundation 
                     for the company’s successful future in 
                     automotive industry. Rover went on to become a major 
                     car manufacturer in the United Kingdom. However,
                     despite solid engineering 
                     developments, the company struggled financially 
                     and had to sell its shares to various manufacturers
                     throughout the history.

                     Latin translation of the surname of the founder,

                     audi" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo 
                     each represent one of four car companies that banded 
                     together to create Audi's predecessor company, 
                     Auto Union.
